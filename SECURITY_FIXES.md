# Security Fixes Applied

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. **PATCH /api/wishes/{wish_id}** - Update Wish
**Issue:** Users could update ANY wish by ID without ownership verification  
**Risk:** High - Users could modify other people's goals  
**Fix Applied:**
- Added authentication check (requires Bearer token)
- Added ownership verification: `Wish.user_id == user.id`
- Returns 401 if not authenticated
- Returns 404 if wish doesn't belong to user

### 2. **DELETE /api/wishes/{wish_id}** - Delete Wish
**Issue:** Users could delete ANY wish by ID without ownership verification  
**Risk:** Critical - Users could delete other people's goals  
**Fix Applied:**
- Added authentication check (requires Bearer token)
- Added ownership verification: `Wish.user_id == user.id`
- Returns 401 if not authenticated
- Returns 404 if wish doesn't belong to user

## Already Secured Endpoints

### ✅ POST /api/wishes/{wish_id}/progress - Create Progress Update
- **Security:** Verified ownership on line 33
- **Check:** `Wish.user_id == current_user.id`
- **Status:** SECURE ✓

### ✅ POST /api/wishes/{wish_id}/mark-failed - Mark as Failed
- **Security:** Verified ownership on line 305
- **Check:** `Wish.user_id == user.id`
- **Status:** SECURE ✓

### ✅ GET /api/wishes - Get User's Wishes
- **Security:** Filters by user_id
- **Check:** `Wish.user_id == user_id`
- **Status:** SECURE ✓

## Public Endpoints (By Design)

These endpoints are intentionally public and don't need ownership checks:

- **GET /api/wishes/public/feed** - Public feed of wishes
- **GET /api/wishes/{wish_id}/progress** - View progress updates (read-only)
- **GET /api/wishes/{wish_id}** - View single wish (read-only)
- **POST /api/engagements/likes** - Like a wish (engagement only)
- **POST /api/engagements/comments** - Comment on a wish (engagement only)
- **POST /api/engagements/views** - Record view (analytics only)

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. ✅ **Authentication Required:** All modification endpoints require Bearer token
2. ✅ **Ownership Verification:** All modification endpoints verify wish belongs to user
3. ✅ **Proper Error Messages:** Returns appropriate 401/404 errors
4. ✅ **Read-Only Public Access:** GET endpoints don't expose sensitive operations
5. ✅ **Engagement Safety:** Likes/comments/views don't modify goal progress

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test as Different Users:**
   - User A creates a goal
   - User B tries to update/delete User A's goal
   - Should get 404 "Wish not found or doesn't belong to you"

2. **Test Without Authentication:**
   - Try to update/delete a wish without Bearer token
   - Should get 401 "Not authenticated"

3. **Test Progress Updates:**
   - User A creates a goal
   - User B tries to add progress to User A's goal
   - Should get 404 "Wish not found or doesn't belong to you"

## Date Fixed
2025-10-23

## Impact
- All goal modification endpoints now require authentication and ownership verification
- Users can only modify their own goals
- Public feed and engagement features remain accessible for community interaction
