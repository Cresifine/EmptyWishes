# Latest Fixes Summary

## All Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. ✅ Public Posts Visibility Fixed
**Problem**: Couldn't see public posts even after creating them.

**Solution**:
- Added `WishVisibility` enum with options: `public`, `followers`, `friends`, `private`
- Default visibility is set to "public"
- Updated feed logic to respect visibility settings based on user relationships
- Implemented proper filtering:
  - Public posts: visible to everyone
  - Followers: visible to users who follow the poster
  - Friends: visible only to mutual followers
  - Private: visible only to the owner

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/app/models/wish.py` - Added WishVisibility enum and visibility column
- `backend/app/schemas/wish.py` - Added visibility to schemas
- `backend/app/api/wishes.py` - Added visibility parameter to create_wish and updated feed logic
- Database recreated with new visibility column

### 2. ✅ Visibility Flags Added
**Solution**:
Users can now control who sees their goals with 4 visibility levels:
- **Public**: Anyone can see (default)
- **Followers**: Only followers can see
- **Friends**: Only mutual followers can see
- **Private**: Only the owner can see

The visibility field is set during goal creation (default is "public").

**Implementation**:
```python
visibility: str = Form("public")  # In create_wish endpoint
```

### 3. ✅ Followers/Following UI on Profile
**Problem**: Couldn't see followers/following counts on own profile.

**Solution**:
- Added followers and following count display to profile screen
- Made them clickable to view lists
- Fetches counts from backend when logged in
- Shows as stat cards with icons (purple for followers, teal for following)

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/lib/screens/profile_screen.dart` - Added followers/following stats

### 4. ✅ Duplicate Settings Button Removed
**Problem**: Had both a Settings list item and a separate Settings section at the bottom.

**Solution**:
- Removed the duplicate "_SettingsCard" section from the bottom
- Kept only the Settings list item in the menu
- Settings button now properly navigates to settings screen

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/lib/screens/profile_screen.dart` - Removed duplicate settings section

## Technical Changes

### Backend Changes
1. **Wish Model**: Added `visibility` field with enum
2. **Feed Logic**: Implemented visibility-aware filtering based on relationships
3. **Database**: Recreated with new `visibility` column in `wishes` table

### Frontend Changes
1. **Profile Stats**: Added followers/following counts with clickable navigation
2. **UI Cleanup**: Removed duplicate settings section
