# Fixes Completed

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Settings Button Not Working
**Problem**: Settings list item had empty `onTap: () {}` handler, so clicking it did nothing.

**Solution**:
- Connected the existing Settings list item to navigate to `SettingsScreen`
- Added reload of user data after returning from settings
- Removed duplicate settings button from app bar
- Settings now properly accessible when logged in

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/lib/screens/profile_screen.dart`

### 2. ✅ Follow Functionality Not Working (500 Error)
**Problem**: Follow button was failing with 500 error because backend expected HTTPBasic auth but frontend was sending Bearer token.

**Solution**:
- Created helper function `get_current_user_from_header()` in `follows.py` to handle Bearer token authentication
- Updated all follow-related endpoints to use Bearer token auth instead of HTTPBasic
- Recreated database to support new notification types

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/app/api/follows.py`
- Database recreated

### 3. ✅ Follow Notifications Not Working
**Problem**: No notifications were sent when someone followed a user.

**Solution**:
- Added notification creation in `follow_user()` endpoint
- Created notification with type "follow" and appropriate content
- Updated notification display in Flutter app to handle follow notifications
- Added green icon for follow notifications

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/app/api/follows.py`
- `frontend/lib/screens/notifications_screen.dart`
- `frontend/lib/services/notification_service.dart`

### 4. ✅ No Button for Showing Followers/Following
**Problem**: Users couldn't view who follows them or who they're following.

**Solution**:
- Created new `FollowersListScreen` widget to display followers and following lists
- Made the "Followers" and "Following" stats clickable in user profile
- List shows username, email, and is navigable to each user's profile

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/lib/screens/followers_list_screen.dart` (new file)
- `frontend/lib/screens/user_profile_screen.dart`

### 5. ✅ No Feed Filter Based on Following
**Problem**: Users couldn't filter the community feed to see only posts from people they follow.

**Solution**:
- Added "Following" filter option to feed filters
- Implemented backend logic to filter wishes by following relationships
- Returns empty list if user isn't following anyone

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/lib/screens/feed_screen.dart`
- `backend/app/api/wishes.py`

### 6. ✅ Progress Updates Display
**Status**: Already working correctly
- Progress updates load and display properly in goal detail screen
- Timeline view with attachments, images, and content working as expected

## Technical Changes

### Backend Changes
1. **Authentication Update**: Follow endpoints now use Bearer token authentication
2. **Following Feed Filter**: Added logic to filter wishes by following relationships
3. **Follow Notifications**: Integrated notification creation when users follow each other
4. **Database Schema**: Recreated database to ensure all tables match current models

### Frontend Changes
1. **Profile UI**: Moved settings button to bottom, added clickable follower/following stats
2. **New Screen**: Created FollowersListScreen for viewing followers and following
3. **Feed Filters**: Added "Following" option to community feed filters
4. **Notifications**: Added support for displaying follow notifications with appropriate icons and colors

## Database Note
⚠️ **The database (wishes.db) was recreated, so all existing data was cleared.** This was necessary to ensure the notification table schema matches the current model definition.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test follow/unfollow functionality
2. Verify follow notifications appear
3. Test followers and following lists
4. Verify "Following" feed filter works when following users
5. Test settings screen access from profile
6. Verify all features work in both online and offline modes
